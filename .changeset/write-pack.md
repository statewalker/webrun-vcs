**Breaking: one streaming pack writer, `writePack`, and `listObjects` to feed it.**

- **New in vcs-core:** `listObjects(objects, { wants, haves, excludes, shallow, onBoundary })` is `git rev-list --objects`: commits by committer time with git's SLOP for clock skew, the trees under the boundary excluded, tags peeled, paths for trees and blobs, shallow commits as boundaries (no deepening). `writePack(objects, ids, options)` is `git pack-objects`, an `AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>` of a v2 pack whose SHA-1 is computed while it streams. It reuses stored entries from a `PackSet` without inflating them (`reuseObjects`, `reuseDeltas`), rewrites OFS offsets, writes a reused delta whole when its base is neither in the pack nor a have, runs git's windowed delta search when asked (`deltaSearch`: window 10, depth 50, bounded window memory), never searches blobs over `bigFileThreshold` (50 MiB), writes thin packs (`thin`, `haves`), defaults to OFS deltas (`ofsDelta`), and reports each entry (`onEntry`) for an idx. Also new: `MissingObjectError`, `DEFAULT_BIG_FILE_THRESHOLD`, `SerializationApi.exportPack(wants, haves, { thinPack, shallow, useDelta, ofsDelta })`.
- **Removed from vcs-core:** the old whole-pack `writePack(objects)` and `PackWriterStream` (`pack-writer`), `StreamingPackWriter`, `PackWriterObject`, `PackWriterResult`, `SerializationApi.createPackBuilder`, `PackBuilder`, `PackBuildStats`, `PackOptions.thinPack`/`onProgress`, `SerializationApiConfig.deltaCompressor`, and `VcsCore.repack()` (a round trip that rewrote nothing). `SerializationApi.createPack` streams through `writePack` (deltas searched unless `useDelta: false`), `serializeLooseObject` deflates the raw object as it streams, `VcsCore.writePack(ids)` is `writePack`, and `PendingPack` flushes through it. vcs-testing's `CraftPackWriter` and `craftPackFile` lay out packs with chosen deltas for tests.
- **Removed from vcs-transport:** `PushObject` and `PushOptions.getObjectsToPush`. `push` needs `exportPack` when it sends objects, and streams the POST body (`ReadableStream`, `duplex: "half"`) where `supportsRequestStreams()`; Firefox and Safari collect it. `httpPush` streams the same way. New: `requestBody`, `supportsRequestStreams`, `toReadableStream`, `PushOptions.streamRequestBody`, `ExportPackOptions.ofsDelta`.
- **Streaming serve (vcs-transport):** `handleUploadPack` returns a `ReadableStream` body pulled by the client, so `HttpResponse.body` is `Uint8Array | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`. `Duplex.write` may return a Promise and every writer awaits it (backpressure; `createGitSocketClient` passes its socket's). The upload-pack server writes a thin pack and OFS deltas only when the client asked for `thin-pack` and `ofs-delta` (the advertised capabilities used to count as requested).
- **Callers:** `RepositoryFacade.exportPack` (both facades), the `PushCommand` and the demos go through `exportPack`; `repack()` in vcs-store-files writes with `writePack`.
